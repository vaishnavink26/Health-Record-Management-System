The system also enables the insertion of medication information and stocks. Users can change their profiles and view available personnel and patients.

Overall, this system provides an efficient and centralized approach to managing medical records, streamlining the process for healthcare professionals and improving patient care.
System was developed primarily using PHP. PHP is a server-side scripting language used primarily for web development. It is often used in conjunction with a database management system such as MySQL to create dynamic web applications.

In addition to PHP, other programming languages and technologies were used to develop the system, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. HTML and CSS are used to create the structure and visual layout of web pages, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages. SQL is a language used to manage and manipulate data stored in a database.
